    <h2>Oxford </h2>

    <div class="container">  
        <p>Oxford Town, Oxford Town
            Ev'rybody's got their hats bowed down
            The sun don't shine above the ground
            Ain't a-goin' down to Oxford Town.
        </p>
        <p>He went down to Oxford Town
            Guns and clubs followed him down 
            All because his face was brown
            Better get away from Oxford Town.</p>
        <p>Oxford Town around the bend
            He comes to the door, he couln't get in
            All because of the color of his skin
            What do you think about that, my frien'?<br><br>

            Me and my gal, my gal's son
            We got met with a tear gas bomb
            I don't even know why we come
            Goin' back where we come from.<br><br>

            Oxford Town in the afternoon
            Ev'rybody singin' a sorrowful tune
            Two men died 'neath the Mississippi moon
            Somebody better investigate soon</p>
